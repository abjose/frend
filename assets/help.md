# Welcome!

Frend is a friendship-management tool, meant to help you keep track of and deepen your
relationships.

[comment]: <> (It is meant for &#40;and made by&#41; people who sometimes forget that being a good friend means)
[comment]: <> (investing time and effort into your friendships.)

# Using Frend

## Events tab

The **Events** tab is the main tab of Frend. Here, you can see a calendar of upcoming and past
events. By pressing on a particular day, you can see and schedule events for that day. Press the +
button in the bottom-right to go to the "Create an Event" page, where you can schedule new events.

## Create an Event page

In the "Create an Event" page, you can see a list of **Event Ideas**. Event Ideas are like
blueprints for new events - feel free to remove or change any of the existing ones, and add your own
ideas! You can edit an Event Idea by tapping on the "edit" (pencil) button on any row.

You can add new Event Ideas by pressing the + button in the bottom-right of the screen, then
selecting "Add Event Idea". You can filter through existing ideas using "Filter by Tag". We'll talk
more about tags later.

To create an Event based on an Event Idea, just press the "copy" (two squares) button on any row.
You can also make a one-off Event by tapping the the + button in the bottom-right corner and
pressing "Create One-off Event". This will take you to the "Add Event" page.

Once you've set the event details as you desire, tap the "save" (floppy disk) button in the top
right of the Add Event page. This will save the event and take you back to the calendar.

## Friends tab

By pressing the **Friends** tab, you can view your Friend list. If you've already added some
friends, you can tap on them here to edit their details. Tapping the + button in the bottom-right
of the screen will take you to the "Add Friend" page.

Some fields that might be confusing on the Add Friend page:

- *Overdue threshold (weeks)*: if specified, a warning symbol will be displayed next to friends that
  don't have an event scheduled within this number of weeks.
- *Friendship Level*: Whether this friend is a "regular" friend, an acquaintance, a friend you've
  fallen out of touch with, etc. Based on your selection, different buttons may appear on the page.

You can also schedule events with specific friends via their Friend page. When you schedule events
through the Edit Friend page, that friend's name and interests will automatically be populated in
the new Event.

## Tags / Interests

**Tags** (sometimes referred to as **Interests**) are used for noting people's interests and for
marking Event Ideas with relevant interests. You can filter through the Event Idea list based on
tags when searching for things to do.

You can edit available tags by tapping on the Gear icon in the top-right of the main screen of
Frend and selecting "Tags" from the dropdown.

That's about it. I hope you enjoy using it, and remember to cherish your friendships.
