[comment]: <> (investing time and effort into your friendships.)

# Using Frend

## Events tab

The "Events" tab is the main tab of Frend. Here, you can see a calendar of upcoming and past events.
By clicking on a particular day, you can see and schedule events for that day. Click the + button
in the bottom-right to go to the "Create an Event" page, where you can schedule new events.

## Create an Event page

In the Create an Event page, you can see a list of Event Ideas. On any Event Idea, click the 
"copy" (two squares) button to create a new event based on that Event Idea; click the "edit" 
(pencil) button to edit the Event Idea itself. Once you've set the event details as you desire,
click the "save" (floppy disk) button in the top right of the Add Event page.

Click on the "Filter by Tag" dropdown to filter through the Event Ideas based on interest.

Click the "One-off Event" button at the top of the page to schedule a new event that isn't based
on an Event Idea.

You can add new Event Ideas by pressing the + button in the bottom-right of the screen.

## Friends tab

By clicking in the "Friends" tab, you can view your Friend list. Clicking the + button in the
bottom-right of the screen will take you to the "Add Friend" screen, where you can edit the details
of a new friend entry. To save the new friend, click the floppy disk icon in the top right.

Some fields that might be confusing on the Friend page:
- *Overdue threshold (weeks)*: if specified, a warning symbol will be displayed next to friends that 
  don't have an event scheduled with this number of weeks.
- *Friendship Level*: Whether this friend is a "regular" friend, an acquaintance, a friend you've
  fallen out of touch with, etc. Based on your selection, different buttons may appear on the page.
- *Interests*: A list of tags describing things this friend is interested in.

Once you've added some friends, they'll appear in the Friends tab. You can click on them to edit
their details, or find buttons to schedule events. When you schedule events through the Edit Friend
page, that friend's name and interests will automatically be populated in the new Event.

## Tags

Tags are used for noting people's interests and for marking Event Ideas with relevant interests.
You can filter through the Event Idea list based on tag when searching for things to do.

You can edit available tags by clicking on the Gear icon in the top-right of the main screen of 
Frend and selecting "Tags" from the dropdown.

That's about it. I hope you enjoy using it, and remember to cherish your friendships.
